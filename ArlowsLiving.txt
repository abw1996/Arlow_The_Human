"IM ARLOW!!!"

Woman - ????

"Will you give me a place to live cunt?"

Woman - "WHAT?"

"Can I have an apartment with a view out front?"

Woman - "Let me see what we have available."
      - "You're in luck!"
      - "I have one with a front view that is rent controlled so the price is only 750 a month."
      - "Would you like me to put together a contract?"

If workingAtNoodleShop = no

	"750 what?"

	Woman - "Well dollars of course."

	"Hey <name>, what is dollars?"

	-Its a form of currency humans use to makes purchases between eachother. You will need to get a job to get money.
	-IDK man I've never had any.

	"Sorry lady, I don't have any money. BUT I REALLY NEED A PLACE TO STAY!"
	
	Woman - "Well we actually need another custodial worker here."
	      - "If you work here we could just take the rent out of your check every month."
	      - "How does that sound?"

	"Beeeeeesh you got a deal"
	
	Woman - "Fantastic, but we will need you to start right away."
	      - "We have a bunch of books in the office that really need to get organized but we haven't had the time."
	      - "Could you get those organized real quick before you get too settled in?"
	      - "Also I can't read so if you could please just organize them by color that would be great."

If workingAtNoodleShop = yes

	"Yeah sure!"

	Woman - "Great! The deposit for this particular apartment is only going to be 250."
	      - "Will you be paying with cash our card?"

	"I'm sorry I only just got a job a little while ago and haven't gotten paid."

	"Is there anything I can do so that we can get the place now?"

	Woman - "Well we do have a bunch of books in the back that need to be organized."
	      - "It would probably take our custodians a while to do it where the job would be worth about 250 in labor."
	      - "Tell you what, if you go organize those books, I will waive the deposit here."
	      - "Does that sound good to you?"

	"That sounds perfect, thanks lady!"

	"I'll get started right away!"

	Woman - "Oh, and one more thing. I can't read so make sure to organze the books by color."
